ASCII C++ Style Guide
=====================

## Classes

Classes are the fundamental unit of code in C++. Naturally, we use them extensively. This section lists the main dos and don'ts you should follow when writing a class.

### Doing Work in Constructors

Avoid virtual method calls in constructors, and avoid initialization that can fail if you can't signal an error.

#### definition
It is possible to perform arbitrary initialization in the body of the constructor.

#### pros

*   No need to worry about whether the class has been initialized or not.
*   Objects that are fully initialized by constructor call can be `const` and may also be easier to use with standard containers or algorithms.

#### cons

*   If the work calls virtual functions, these calls will not get dispatched to the subclass implementations. Future modification to your class can quietly introduce this problem even if your class is not currently subclassed, causing much confusion.
*   There is no easy way for constructors to signal errors, short of crashing the program (not always appropriate) or using exceptions (which are [forbidden](#Exceptions)).
*   If the work fails, we now have an object whose initialization code failed, so it may be an unusual state requiring a `BOL IsValid()` state checking mechanism (or similar) which is easy to forget to call.
*   You cannot take the address of a constructor, so whatever work is done in the constructor cannot easily be handed off to, for example, another thread.

#### decision

Constructors should never call virtual functions. If appropriate for your code , terminating the program may be an appropriate error handling response. Otherwise, consider a factory function or `Init()` method as described in [TotW #42](https://abseil.io/tips/42) . Avoid `Init()` methods on objects with no other states that affect which public methods may be called (semi-constructed objects of this form are particularly hard to work with correctly).
<a id="Explicit_Constructors</a>

### Implicit Conversions

Do not define implicit conversions. Use the `explicit` keyword for conversion operators and single-argument constructors.

#### definition

Implicit conversions allow an object of one type (called the <dfn>source type</dfn>) to be used where a different type (called the <dfn>destination type</dfn>) is expected, such as when passing an `int` argument to a function that takes a `DBL` parameter.

In addition to the implicit conversions defined by the language, users can define their own, by adding appropriate members to the class definition of the source or destination type. An implicit conversion in the source type is defined by a type conversion operator named after the destination type (e.g. `operator BOL()`). An implicit conversion in the destination type is defined by a constructor that can take the source type as its only argument (or only argument with no default value).

The `explicit` keyword can be applied to a constructor or (since C++11) a conversion operator, to ensure that it can only be used when the destination type is explicit at the point of use, e.g. with a cast. This applies not only to implicit conversions, but to C++11's list initialization syntax:

```C++
class Foo {
  explicit Foo(int x, DBL y);
  ...
};
void Func(Foo f);
```

#### badcode

```C++
Func({42, 3.14});  // Error
```

This kind of code isn't technically an implicit conversion, but the language treats it as one as far as `explicit` is concerned.

#### pros

*   Implicit conversions can make a type more usable and expressive by eliminating the need to explicitly name a type when it's obvious.
*   Implicit conversions can be a simpler alternative to overloading, such as when a single function with a `string_view` parameter takes the place of separate overloads for `string` and `const char*`.
*   List initialization syntax is a concise and expressive way of initializing objects.
#### cons
*   Implicit conversions can hide type-mismatch bugs, where the destination type does not match the user's expectation, or the user is unaware that any conversion will take place.
*   Implicit conversions can make code harder to read, particularly in the presence of overloading, by making it less obvious what code is actually getting called.
*   Constructors that take a single argument may accidentally be usable as implicit type conversions, even if they are not intended to do so.
*   When a single-argument constructor is not marked `explicit`, there's no reliable way to tell whether it's intended to define an implicit conversion, or the author simply forgot to mark it.
*   It's not always clear which type should provide the conversion, and if they both do, the code becomes ambiguous.
*   List initialization can suffer from the same problems if the destination type is implicit, particularly if the list has only a single element.

#### decision

Type conversion operators, and constructors that are callable with a single argument, must be marked `explicit` in the class definition. As an exception, copy and move constructors should not be `explicit`, since they do not perform type conversion. Implicit conversions can sometimes be necessary and appropriate for types that are designed to transparently wrap other types. In that case, contact your project leads to request a waiver of this rule.
Constructors that cannot be called with a single argument may omit `explicit`. Constructors that take a single `std::initializer_list` parameter should also omit `explicit`, in order to support copy-initialization (e.g. `MyType m = {1, 2};`).

### Copyable and Movable Types

<a id="Copy_Constructors</a>

A class's public API should make explicit whether the class is copyable, move-only, or neither copyable nor movable. Support copying and/or moving if these operations are clear and meaningful for your type.

#### definition

A movable type is one that can be initialized and assigned from temporaries.

A copyable type is one that can be initialized or assigned from any other object of the same type (so is also movable by definition), with the stipulation that the value of the source does not change. `std::unique_ptr<int>` is an example of a movable but not copyable type (since the value of the source `std::unique_ptr<int>` must be modified during assignment to the destination). `int` and `string` are examples of movable types that are also copyable. (For `int`, the move and copy operations are the same; for `string`, there exists a move operation that is less expensive than a copy.)

For user-defined types, the copy behavior is defined by the copy constructor and the copy-assignment operator. Move behavior is defined by the move constructor and the move-assignment operator, if they exist, or by the copy constructor and the copy-assignment operator otherwise.

The copy/move constructors can be implicitly invoked by the compiler in some situations, e.g. when passing objects by value.

#### pros

Objects of copyable and movable types can be passed and returned by value, which makes APIs simpler, safer, and more general. Unlike when passing objects by pointer or reference, there's no risk of confusion over ownership, lifetime, mutability, and similar issues, and no need to specify them in the contract. It also prevents non-local interactions between the client and the implementation, which makes them easier to understand, maintain, and optimize by the compiler. Further, such objects can be used with generic APIs that require pass-by-value, such as most containers, and they allow for additional flexibility in e.g., type composition.
Copy/move constructors and assignment operators are usually easier to define correctly than alternatives like `Clone()`, `CopyFrom()` or `Swap()`, because they can be generated by the compiler, either implicitly or with `= default`. They are concise, and ensure that all data members are copied. Copy and move constructors are also generally more efficient, because they don't require heap allocation or separate initialization and assignment steps, and they're eligible for optimizations such as [copy elision](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/copy_elision).
Move operations allow the implicit and efficient transfer of resources out of rvalue objects. This allows a plainer coding style in some cases.

#### cons

Some types do not need to be copyable, and providing copy operations for such types can be confusing, nonsensical, or outright incorrect. Types representing singleton objects (`Registerer`), objects tied to a specific scope (`Cleanup`), or closely coupled to object identity (`Mutex`) cannot be copied meaningfully. Copy operations for base class types that are to be used polymorphically are hazardous, because use of them can lead to [object slicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_slicing). Defaulted or carelessly-implemented copy operations can be incorrect, and the resulting bugs can be confusing and difficult to diagnose.

Copy constructors are invoked implicitly, which makes the invocation easy to miss. This may cause confusion for programmers used to languages where pass-by-reference is conventional or mandatory. It may also encourage excessive copying, which can cause performance problems.

#### decision

Every class's public interface should make explicit which copy and move operations the class supports. This should usually take the form of explicitly declaring and/or deleting the appropriate operations in the `public` section of the declaration.

Specifically, a copyable class should explicitly declare the copy operations, a move-only class should explicitly declare the move operations, and a non-copyable/movable class should explicitly delete the copy operations. Explicitly declaring or deleting all four copy/move operations is permitted, but not required. If you provide a copy or move assignment operator, you must also provide the corresponding constructor.

```C++
class Copyable {
 public:
  Copyable(const Copyable& rhs) = default;
  Copyable& operator=(const Copyable& rhs) = default;
  // The implicit move operations are suppressed by the declarations above.
};
class MoveOnly {
 public:
  MoveOnly(MoveOnly&& rhs);
  MoveOnly& operator=(MoveOnly&& rhs);
  // The copy operations are implicitly deleted, but you can
  // spell that out explicitly if you want:
  MoveOnly(const MoveOnly&) = delete;
  MoveOnly& operator=(const MoveOnly&) = delete;
};
class NotCopyableOrMovable {
 public:
  // Not copyable or movable
  NotCopyableOrMovable(const NotCopyableOrMovable&) = delete;
  NotCopyableOrMovable& operator=(const NotCopyableOrMovable&)
      = delete;
  // The move operations are implicitly disabled, but you can
  // spell that out explicitly if you want:
  NotCopyableOrMovable(NotCopyableOrMovable&&) = delete;
  NotCopyableOrMovable& operator=(NotCopyableOrMovable&&)
      = delete;
};
```

These declarations/deletions can be omitted only if they are obvious: for example, if a base class isn't copyable or movable, derived classes naturally won't be either. Similarly, a [struct](#Structs_vs._Classes)'s copyability/movability is normally determined by the copyability/movability of its data members (this does not apply to classes because in Google code their data members are not public). Note that if you explicitly declare or delete any of the copy/move operations, the others are not obvious, and so this paragraph does not apply (in particular, the rules in this section that apply to "classes" also apply to structs that declare or delete any copy/move operations).

A type should not be copyable/movable if the meaning of copying/moving is unclear to a casual user, or if it incurs unexpected costs. Move operations for copyable types are strictly a performance optimization and are a potential source of bugs and complexity, so avoid defining them unless they are significantly more efficient than the corresponding copy operations. If your type provides copy operations, it is recommended that you design your class so that the default implementation of those operations is correct. Remember to review the correctness of any defaulted operations as you would any other code.

Due to the risk of slicing, prefer to avoid providing a public assignment operator or copy/move constructor for a class that's intended to be derived from (and prefer to avoid deriving from a class with such members). If your base class needs to be copyable, provide a public virtual `Clone()` method, and a protected copy constructor that derived classes can use to implement it.

### Structs vs. Classes

Use a `struct` only for passive objects that carry data; everything else is a `class`.

The `struct` and `class` keywords behave almost identically in C++. We add our own semantic meanings to each keyword, so you should use the appropriate keyword for the data-type you're defining.

`structs` should be used for passive objects that carry data, and may have associated constants, but lack any functionality other than access/setting the data members. The accessing/setting of fields is done by directly accessing the fields rather than through method invocations. Methods should not provide behavior but should only be used to set up the data members, e.g., constructor, destructor, `Initialize()`, `Reset()`, `Validate()`.

If more functionality is required, a `class` is more appropriate. If in doubt, make it a `class`.

For consistency with STL, you can use `struct` instead of `class` for functors and traits.

Note that member variables in structs and classes have [different naming rules](#Variable_Names).

<a id="Multiple_Inheritance</a>

### Inheritance

Composition is often more appropriate than inheritance. When using inheritance, make it `public`.

#### definition

When a sub-class inherits from a base class, it includes the definitions of all the data and operations that the base class defines. "Interface inheritance" is inheritance from a pure abstract base class (one with no state or defined methods); all other inheritance is "implementation inheritance".

#### pros

Implementation inheritance reduces code size by re-using the base class code as it specializes an existing type. Because inheritance is a compile-time declaration, you and the compiler can understand the operation and detect errors. Interface inheritance can be used to programmatically enforce that a class expose a particular API. Again, the compiler can detect errors, in this case, when a class does not define a necessary method of the API.

#### cons

For implementation inheritance, because the code implementing a sub-class is spread between the base and the sub-class, it can be more difficult to understand an implementation. The sub-class cannot override functions that are not virtual, so the sub-class cannot change implementation.

Multiple inheritance is especially problematic, because it often imposes a higher performance overhead (in fact, the performance drop from single inheritance to multiple inheritance can often be greater than the performance drop from ordinary to virtual dispatch), and because it risks leading to "diamond" inheritance patterns, which are prone to ambiguity, confusion, and outright bugs.

#### decision

All inheritance should be `public`. If you want to do private inheritance, you should be including an instance of the base class as a member instead.

Do not overuse implementation inheritance. Composition is often more appropriate. Try to restrict use of inheritance to the "is-a" case: `Bar` subclasses `Foo` if it can reasonably be said that `Bar` "is a kind of" `Foo`.

Limit the use of `protected` to those member functions that might need to be accessed from subclasses. Note that [data members should be private](#Access_Control).

Explicitly annotate overrides of virtual functions or virtual destructors with exactly one of an `override` or (less frequently) `final` specifier. Do not use `virtual` when declaring an override. Rationale: A function or destructor marked `override` or `final` that is not an override of a base class virtual function will not compile, and this helps catch common errors. The specifiers serve as documentation; if no specifier is present, the reader has to check all ancestors of the class in question to determine if the function or destructor is virtual or not.

Multiple inheritance is permitted, but multiple _implementation_ inheritance is strongly discouraged.

### Operator Overloading

Overload operators judiciously. Do not create user-defined literals.

#### definition

C++ permits user code to [declare overloaded versions of the built-in operators](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operators) using the `operator` keyword, so long as one of the parameters is a user-defined type. The `operator` keyword also permits user code to define new kinds of literals using `operator""`, and to define type-conversion functions such as `operator BOL()`.

#### pros

Operator overloading can make code more concise and intuitive by enabling user-defined types to behave the same as built-in types. Overloaded operators are the idiomatic names for certain operations (e.g. `==`, `<`, `=`, and `<<`), and adhering to those conventions can make user-defined types more readable and enable them to interoperate with libraries that expect those names.

User-defined literals are a very concise notation for creating objects of user-defined types.

#### cons

*   Providing a correct, consistent, and unsurprising set of operator overloads requires some care, and failure to do so can lead to confusion and bugs.
*   Overuse of operators can lead to obfuscated code, particularly if the overloaded operator's semantics don't follow convention.
*   The hazards of function overloading apply just as much to operator overloading, if not more so.
*   Operator overloads can fool our intuition into thinking that expensive operations are cheap, built-in operations.
*   Finding the call sites for overloaded operators may require a search tool that's aware of C++ syntax, rather than e.g. grep.
*   If you get the argument type of an overloaded operator wrong, you may get a different overload rather than a compiler error. For example, `foo < bar` may do one thing, while `&foo < &bar` does something totally different.
*   Certain operator overloads are inherently hazardous. Overloading unary `&` can cause the same code to have different meanings depending on whether the overload declaration is visible. Overloads of `&&`, `||`, and `,` (comma) cannot match the evaluation-order semantics of the built-in operators.
*   Operators are often defined outside the class, so there's a risk of different files introducing different definitions of the same operator. If both definitions are linked into the same binary, this results in undefined behavior, which can manifest as subtle run-time bugs.
*   User-defined literals allow the creation of new syntactic forms that are unfamiliar even to experienced C++ programmers.

#### decision

Define overloaded operators only if their meaning is obvious, unsurprising, and consistent with the corresponding built-in operators. For example, use `|` as a bitwise- or logical-or, not as a shell-style pipe.

Define operators only on your own types. More precisely, define them in the same headers, .cc files, and namespaces as the types they operate on. That way, the operators are available wherever the type is, minimizing the risk of multiple definitions. If possible, avoid defining operators as templates, because they must satisfy this rule for any possible template arguments. If you define an operator, also define any related operators that make sense, and make sure they are defined consistently. For example, if you overload `<`, overload all the comparison operators, and make sure `<` and `>` never return true for the same arguments.

Prefer to define non-modifying binary operators as non-member functions. If a binary operator is defined as a class member, implicit conversions will apply to the right-hand argument, but not the left-hand one. It will confuse your users if `a < b` compiles but `b < a` doesn't.

Don't go out of your way to avoid defining operator overloads. For example, prefer to define `==`, `=`, and `<<`, rather than `Equals()`, `CopyFrom()`, and `PrintTo()`. Conversely, don't define operator overloads just because other libraries expect them. For example, if your type doesn't have a natural ordering, but you want to store it in a `std::set`, use a custom comparator rather than overloading `<`.

Do not overload `&&`, `||`, `,` (comma), or unary `&`. Do not overload `operator""`, i.e. do not introduce user-defined literals.

Type conversion operators are covered in the section on [implicit conversions](#Implicit_Conversions). The `=` operator is covered in the section on [copy constructors](#Copy_Constructors). Overloading `<<` for use with streams is covered in the section on [streams](#Streams). See also the rules on [function overloading](#Function_Overloading), which apply to operator overloading as well.

### Access Control

Make classes' data members `private`, unless they are `static const` (and follow the [naming convention for constants](#Constant_Names)).

For technical reasons, we allow data members of a test fixture class in a .cc file to be `protected` when using [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest)).

### Declaration Order

Group similar declarations together, placing public parts earlier.

A class definition should usually start with a `public:` section, followed by `protected:`, then `private:`. Omit sections that would be empty.

Within each section, generally prefer grouping similar kinds of declarations together, and generally prefer the following order: types (including `typedef`, `using`, and nested structs and classes), constants, factory functions, constructors, assignment operators, destructor, all other methods, data members.

Do not put large method definitions inline in the class definition. Usually, only trivial or performance-critical, and very short, methods may be defined inline. See [Inline Functions](#Inline_Functions) for more details.
