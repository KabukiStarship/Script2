# Freedom Government Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We will never be #woke lib-tard authoritarian trash who spout off critical race and gender theory nonsense. Only 3% of open-source contributions are from women. Our pledge is to not burn the people who do contribute to try to make girls who don't contribute like us.

## Our Standards

You can take your Code of Conduct and shove it up your ass!

## Our Responsibilities

We ain't responsible for shit. I'm responsible to ensure an environement that fosters free speech, free association, free press, free religion, and open expression of ideas. This includes ideas you don't like. You are responsible to not be a drama queen and get butt hurt and flip a wig whenever you encounter ideas that contracdict your cultural conditioning and preconceptions.

#### Scope

The scope is creep. You either respect the US Constitution or GTFO!

#### Enforcement

I'll ban you just because I want to, espechially if you're a goodie-goodie or #woke lib-tard spouting off some critical race or geneder theory horse shit.

#### Attribution

Jesus.
