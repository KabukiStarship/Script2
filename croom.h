/* A Chinese Room.
An Chinese Room works the same way as in the Chinese Room thought
experiment. An Room receives a message through a slot in the door, the man
in the room reads does manual optical character recognition with a pen and
paper stack, some filing cabinets, and a library of multimaps.
  The size of the CCrabs Stack is defined by the Script Protocol to be a
a maximum of 2^15-1 expressions tall.
# Memory Layout
Some systems have the stack grow up from the bottom and heap grow up and
vice versa.
@code

# ASCII Mappings

The mapping of the layout of the Chinese Room can be seen in the following
super cute ASCII house is:

@code
 _________
/_________\
[_#_]@[_#_]

# Room Connections

There are multiple doors in a Chinese Room that lead to other Chinese Rooms.
Each door has multiple slots in lead to the same room. These slots are the
various IO ports of the system.

# Doors

There are two ways to access Doors in the CR. in the Root Scope, there are:

@code
Use Case Scenario:
Actors: Jo  - The app developer.
        Sam - The end-user.
1.  Jo is creating an App and needs to make a Chinese Room so Jo downloads
    Script, starts his app, and makes a Room. Jo defines a Floor
    statically but is does not define any walls.
    2.  Host creates a memory stack without any heap space.
2.  Jo needs to add a UART port out to his App so he adds a BOut with a
    slot_size of 2KB.
    3.  Host adds the Slot to the Program Stack.
4.  Jo needs to add a SPI IO device so he initializes a Slot with 256
    bytes.
    5.  Host adds the new Slot on top of the Slot.
6.  Jo is out of memory in the Floor so he creates a Ceiling of size 2KB.
    7.  Host creates a Heap Block for the Ceiling.
7.  Jo needs Interprocess communication to three threads: one SlotIn,
    one SlotOut, and a Slot of size 2KB.
    8.  Host adds the SlotIn, MirroOut, and Slot to the Ceiling.
9.  Jo wants to add a Server so Jo creates Wall_1 with 1MB space.
    10. Host creates a Wall_1 with 1MB memory.
11. Jo wants needs to distribute information to the end-users so Jo
    creates Dictionary in Wall_1 with some keys and values.
    12. Host creates dictionary and adds keys and values.
13. Jo complies the program and launches the server.
    14. Host loads.
15. Sam launches Jo's app and connections to the Host.
    16. Host receives login attempt from Sam and opens a Door for him.
17. Sam needs to get the values Jo stored in step 11 so Same sends a
    Dictionary GET request.
