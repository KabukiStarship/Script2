## [Universal Addressing Specification]()

**Universal Addressing** or UA is a method of conveying physical addresses and Internet Protocol Addressing that works identically on every planet or spherical object. Before we talk about a UA it helps to see a map of the internet wires on Earth. Here is Earth's Internet Superhighway in the year 2017 center about 0 degrees longitude.

The method uses a minimum of a 96-bit IP Address that conveys latitude, longitude, and height above or below sea level in the minimum unit of one-degree longitude and latitude. Exact precision is possible using varints and the **Least Significant Longitudinal Unit**, a standard metric unit used to represent the height above or below sea-level in terms of one-degree longitude at the equator. Because a Script Datagram may be of 0 bytes in length but a header may be up to 40 bytes in length, implementations may require a minimum Datagram length of 40 bytes.
